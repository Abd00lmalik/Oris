# ARCHON — COMPLETE PLATFORM DOCUMENTATION

## SECTION 1: WHAT IS ARCHON?

### 1.1 The Core Problem It Solves

#### Why on-chain reputation matters
- Most online reputation systems are easy to fake: screenshots can be edited, testimonials can be bought, and portfolios can include work the person never completed.
- Hiring decisions (for freelancers, contributors, and AI agents) usually depend on trust in off-chain claims.
- Without verifiable proof, clients and teams cannot reliably separate real performers from reputation farming.

#### Who gets hurt today without a system like this
- Task creators and employers: they can pay or onboard people with inflated credentials.
- Serious contributors: their real work is diluted by low-trust competitors.
- AI agent operators: there is no durable, interoperable proof that an autonomous agent actually delivered real outcomes.
- Communities/DAOs: moderation and governance effort is hard to prove across platforms.

#### How Archon fixes it
- Archon converts real completed activity into on-chain credentials through contract-enforced workflows.
- Credentials are minted only after objective state transitions (for example: accepted task -> submitted deliverable -> approved).
- Verification is public and direct from chain state, not platform screenshots.
- Reputation score is computed from credential weights and cannot be manually edited by users.

### 1.2 The Core Mechanic

#### What a credential is (plain English)
- A credential is a permanent blockchain record that says: "this wallet completed this activity and got validated by this source contract at this time."

#### What a reputation score is
- A reputation score is the sum of credential weights attached to one wallet, capped at 2000.
- In frontend code (`frontend/src/lib/reputation.ts`), weighted score is:

```ts
const total = credentials.reduce((sum, credential) => sum + (credential.weight ?? 100), 0);
return Math.min(total, 2000);
```

#### Why credentials cannot be faked, deleted, or transferred
- Faked: minting requires authorized issuer flow via `CredentialHook` + source contracts.
- Deleted: there is no delete function in registry.
- Transferred: credentials are stored against the `agent` address in registry mappings; they are identity-bound, not tradable assets.

#### Difference between credentials and NFTs
- NFTs are usually transferable ownership tokens.
- Archon credentials are non-transferable proof records tied to `(agent, activity, sourceType)` and used for reputation.
- Archon credentials are represented as registry structs, not a transferable token standard in this codebase.

### 1.3 Who Uses Archon and How

#### Task Creators
- Post structured work with USDC reward pools in `ERC8183Job`.
- Must be approved in `SourceRegistry` for `"job"` or `"task"` before `createJob` succeeds.
- Review submissions and assign variable per-agent rewards.

#### Contributors / Agents
- Accept open tasks.
- Submit deliverable links.
- If approved, claim reward + credential.
- Can also earn from community, governance, and (contract-side) GitHub/peer sources.

#### AI Agents
- Primary fit for `AgentTaskSource`: machine-readable input/output, validation step, USDC payout, credential mint.
- Same wallet-level reputation logic applies to autonomous and human-operated wallets.

#### Community Moderators
- Registered in `CommunitySource` by owner and must also be approved in `SourceRegistry` for `"community"`.
- Review community applications and approve/reject.
- Can award activity through application approval flow.

#### Platform Admin
- Owner-level powers across contracts:
  - Approve/revoke source operators (SourceRegistry owner)
  - Register/deactivate moderators (CommunitySource owner)
  - Add/remove governors (DAOGovernanceSource owner)
  - Set fee and posting rules (ERC8183Job owner)
  - Add/remove arbitrators and fee in MilestoneEscrow owner

### 1.4 The Token Economy

#### How USDC flows through the system (exact paths)

1. Regular Tasks (`ERC8183Job`)
- Creator calls `createJob(...)`.
- Contract executes `usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), rewardUSDC)`.
- On claim:
  - Fee: `usdc.transfer(platformTreasury, platformFee)`
  - Net: `usdc.transfer(agent, agentReward)`

2. Agentic Tasks (`AgentTaskSource`)
- Poster calls `postTask(...)` with USDC transferFrom escrow.
- On `claimRewardAndCredential(...)`:
  - Fee -> `platformTreasury`
  - Net -> `assignedAgent`

3. Milestone Contracts (`MilestoneEscrow`)
- Client funds milestone individually via `fundMilestone` (`transferFrom`).
- If approved/auto-release/favor freelancer:
  - Fee -> `owner` (important: this contract routes fee to `owner`, not `platformTreasury` variable)
  - Net -> freelancer
- If favor client in dispute:
  - full amount refunded to client

#### Platform fee: what it is, where it goes, who controls it
- Represented in basis points.
- `ERC8183Job.platformFeeBps` + `platformTreasury`, owner-set via `setPlatformConfig`.
- `AgentTaskSource.platformFeeBps` + `platformTreasury`, configurable by approved `agent_task` operator via `setPlatformConfig`.
- `MilestoneEscrow.platformFeeBps`, owner-set via `setPlatformFee`; fee paid to `owner` inside `_releaseFunds`.

#### What happens to escrow if a task expires
- `ERC8183Job.refundExpiredJob(jobId)` allows client refund after deadline if unallocated/unclaimed balance exists.
- `AgentTaskSource.refundExpiredTask(taskId)` allows poster refund if status is `Open` or `InProgress` after deadline.
- `MilestoneEscrow` has no direct "expire and refund" shortcut; dispute and window mechanics govern release/refund.

#### Platform treasury address and control
- Current configured treasury in deployment JSON:
  - `0x25265b9dBEb6c653b0CA281110Bb0697a9685107`
- Controlled by whoever manages that wallet/safe externally.
- Updatable in job contract by owner.

- Sets Approved and releases funds.

```solidity
function voteOnDispute(uint256 milestoneId, DisputeOutcome vote) external nonReentrant
```
- Assigned arbitrators only.
- One vote per arbitrator.
- Resolution check begins once >=2 votes received.
- If `FavorFreelancer >= 2`: mark resolved, status ArbitratorResolved, release funds.
- If `FavorClient >= 2`: mark resolved, status Refunded, refund client.

```solidity
function addArbitrator(address arbitrator) external onlyOwner
function removeArbitrator(address arbitrator) external onlyOwner
function setPlatformFee(uint256 feeBps) external onlyOwner
```

```solidity
function getMilestone(uint256 milestoneId) external view returns (Milestone memory)
function getMilestonesByProject(uint256 projectId) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
function getMilestonesByClient(address client) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
function getMilestonesByFreelancer(address freelancer) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
function getDispute(uint256 milestoneId) external view returns (Dispute memory)
function getArbitratorCount() external view returns (uint256)
function getArbitrators() external view returns (address[] memory)
```

#### Full lifecycle from propose to complete
1. Client proposes project with N milestones.
2. Each milestone is funded separately.
3. Freelancer submits deliverable for funded milestone.
4. Client either:
   - approves immediately -> payout, or
   - raises dispute within 48h.
5. If client does nothing for 48h, freelancer can auto-release.
6. If disputed, three arbitrators vote; majority determines payout/refund.

#### 48-hour dispute window behavior
- Window starts at `submittedAt` when deliverable is submitted.
- Client/freelancer can dispute only until `submittedAt + DISPUTE_WINDOW`.
- After this, dispute path closes and freelancer can auto-release (if no dispute exists).

#### Arbitrator selection algorithm
- Requires at least 3 arbitrators in registry.
- Seed: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(milestoneId, block.timestamp, block.prevrandao))`.
- Picks indices derived from seed and length.
- Deduplicates second and third picks with loops until unique.

#### 3-of-3 majority behavior in actual code
- Contract resolves after at least 2 votes (`votesReceived >= 2`).
- It then counts votes across 3 slots.
- Any side reaching >=2 wins.
- Third vote is unnecessary once majority exists.

#### Fund outcomes by path
- Approve / Auto-release / FavorFreelancer:
  - fee = amount * bps / 10000
  - fee -> `owner`
  - net -> freelancer
- FavorClient:
  - full amount -> client
- `totalEscrowed` is decremented on release/refund.

## SECTION 3: THE CREDENTIAL SYSTEM

### 3.1 What Goes Into a Credential

#### `Credential` struct fields (registry)
- `uint256 credentialId`
- `address agent`
- `uint256 jobId` (reused activity ID for all sources)
- `uint256 issuedAt`
- `address issuedBy`
- `bool valid`
- `string sourceType`
- `uint256 weight`

#### `sourceType` meaning and values
Observed source type values from contracts/UI:
- `job`
- `agent_task`
- `community`
- `peer_attestation`
- `dao_governance`
- `github`

#### `weight` meaning
- Numeric contribution to reputation score for that credential.
- Different source activities assign different weight.

#### How permanently bound to wallet
- Issuance key is stored per `agent` in registry mappings.
- Uniqueness mapping includes agent key.
- There is no transfer function.

### 3.2 The Six Credential Sources

#### 1) Tasks (`ERC8183Job`) 
- Activity: accepted task, submitted deliverable, creator approval, claim.
- Verifier: task creator (client).
- Steps: `acceptJob -> submitDeliverable -> approveSubmission -> claimCredential`.
- Weight: 100.
- USDC paid: yes.
- Anti-gaming: operator gate, min stake, duration/review delays, cooldown, max approvals, allocation checks, suspicion score.

#### 2) Agentic Tasks (`AgentTaskSource`)
- Activity: claim/open task, submit output, validation, claim reward.
- Verifier: approved operator or poster.
- Weight: 130.
- USDC paid: yes.
- Anti-gaming: posting gate, deadline checks, validation delay, cooldown, refund logic.

#### 3) Community Work (`CommunitySource`)
- Activity: submit application -> moderator approval -> claim credential.
- Verifier: active moderator.
- Weight: by type (50/80/90/120/100).
- USDC paid: no.
- Anti-gaming: moderator gate, min description length, rejection-note requirement, cooldown.

#### 4) Peer Vouching (`PeerAttestationSource`)
- Activity: eligible wallet attests another wallet.
- Verifier: no moderator; strict eligibility and limits enforce scarcity.
- Weight: 60.
- USDC paid: no.
- Anti-gaming: 1000-point threshold, weekly caps, mutual attestation block, note length minimum.

#### 5) DAO Governance (`DAOGovernanceSource`)
- Activity: prove on-chain vote in approved governor.
- Verifier: trustless contract call to governor `hasVoted`.
- Weight: 90.
- USDC paid: no.
- Anti-gaming: approved governor list, one-claim-per-proposal map, cooldown.

#### 6) GitHub (`GitHubSource` contract exists)
- Contract supports submit->approve/reject->claim with variable weights.
- Frontend `/github` currently directs users to task flow instead of on-page GitHub claim UI.

### 3.3 The Reputation Score System

#### Exact weighted score formula
```ts
const total = credentials.reduce((sum, credential) => sum + (credential.weight ?? 100), 0);
return Math.min(total, 2000);
```

#### Tier thresholds (from `reputation.ts`)
- Surveyor: 0–99
- Draftsman: 100–299
- Architect: 300–599
- Master Builder: 600–999
- Keystone: 1000–1499
- Arc Founder: 1500–2000

#### Tier colors in current UI implementation
- Source-type colors are explicit; tier-specific colors are not uniquely mapped per tier in code.
- Current reputation card displays tier text using accent color `#00D1B2` for active tier label.
- Progress bar fill also uses `#00D1B2`.

#### Unlocks
- Critical unlock in code/contracts: peer vouching requires Keystone threshold (>=1000).

#### Score breakdown by source type
- `getScoreBreakdown` groups credentials by normalized source buckets and sums weights.
- Profile displays human labels and totals per source.

#### 2000-point cap and why it exists
- Hard cap prevents infinite score inflation and keeps tiers bounded.

### 3.4 Anti-Gaming Architecture

For each mechanism: attack blocked, logic, bypass difficulty.

1. SourceRegistry approval requirement
- Blocks unvetted source operators from posting sensitive source activities.
- Example requires:
  - Job: `isApprovedFor("job") || isApprovedFor("task")`
  - AgentTask: `isApprovedFor("agent_task")`
- Bypass requires owner compromise or approved operator collusion.

2. Minimum USDC stake per task
- Blocks near-zero-value spam tasks.
- `createJob` requires:
  - `rewardUSDC >= minJobStake`
  - `rewardUSDC >= minJobStake * maxApprovals`
- Bypass requires locking real capital.

3. `MIN_JOB_DURATION` time lock
- Blocks instant create->approve farming.
- `approveSubmission`: `block.timestamp >= job.createdAt + MIN_JOB_DURATION`.

4. `MIN_REVIEW_DELAY`
- Blocks immediate submit->approve loops.
- `approveSubmission`: `block.timestamp >= submission.submittedAt + MIN_REVIEW_DELAY`.

5. `CREDENTIAL_COOLDOWN` (6h)
- Blocks rapid repeated claim loops from one wallet.
- Enforced in job, agent task, community, governance paths.

6. Flexible max approvals (1-20)
- Prevents unlimited approvals per job.
- `approvedAgentCount < maxApprovalsForJob[jobId]`.

7. Variable reward per approved submission
- Forces explicit per-approval allocation.
- Allocation cannot exceed escrow:
  - `alreadyAllocated + rewardAmount <= job.rewardUSDC`.

8. Suspicion scoring
- Flags high-risk patterns for human review.
- Signals: very fast submissions, high-volume pairing.
- Informational only; does not auto-block.

9. Keystone requirement for peer vouching
- Prevents low-history wallets from issuing trust attestations.
- Require: weighted score >= 1000.

10. Mutual attestation block
- Prevents direct reciprocal vouch circles.
- Require: `!hasAttestedBefore[recipient][msg.sender]`.

11. Weekly attestation limits
- Giver max 2/week, recipient max 1/week.
- Makes collusive farming slow and visible.

12. Minimum 50-char attestation note
- Forces explanatory public text, raising social/audit cost of fake vouches.

13. MilestoneEscrow dispute window
- Prevents indefinite withholding of outcomes.
- After 48h inactivity, freelancer auto-release available.

14. MilestoneEscrow majority arbitration
- 3 arbitrators, outcome requires majority side (>=2 votes).
- Makes unilateral party control harder.

## SECTION 4: PAGE-BY-PAGE USER GUIDE

### 4.1 Home Page (`/`)

#### What this page is for
- Main activity feed and entry point for open tasks.

#### Who should use it
- Everyone: creators, contributors, and new users.

#### Requirements
- Wallet optional for browsing.
- Wallet required for personalized actions and state labels.

#### What the stats bar means
- Credentials Minted: `ValidationRegistry.totalCredentials()`.
- Open Tasks Available: count of jobs with status open.
- USDC in Escrow: remaining reward pools + milestone escrow total.
- Credentials Issued: displayed from credential total (acts as lower-bound activity metric).

#### Welcome banner behavior
- Shows only when wallet connected, has zero credentials, and no prior submission history.
- Dismiss is persisted in `localStorage` key per wallet.

#### Task grid and card reading
- Shows title, status badge, reward pool, max winners, paid out amount, deadline, creator activity, and counts.
- Action buttons vary by viewer:
  - Creator: `Review Submissions (N)`
  - Agent with submission: `View My Submission`
  - Agent without submission: `View & Apply`
  - All: `View Job`

#### Step-by-step
1. Open `/`.
2. Read stats and recent credentials.
3. Scroll to `Open Tasks`.
4. Click `View Job` (or contextual action) for target task.

#### Common errors
- Data load failure: inline red error card appears.
- Stats load failure: stats show `—` silently for failed metrics.

#### Tips
- Use `My Work` for a focused dashboard after accepting tasks.
- Use `Refresh` button after submitting/approving to pull latest state.

---

### 4.2 Earn Page (`/earn`)

#### What this page is for
- Explains all current credential earning paths.

#### Who should use it
- New users learning the system and existing users tracking source counts.

#### Requirements
- Wallet optional.
- Wallet needed for "you have earned N" values and current score/tier.

#### Source cards shown (current UI)
1. Complete Tasks
2. Agentic Tasks
3. Community Work
4. Peer Vouching
5. DAO Governance

#### Weight badge reading
- Badge text shows per-source weight model (fixed or range).

#### USDC vs reputation-only
- Paid cards include wallet icon and paid wording.
- Reputation-only cards include star icon and no payout promise.

#### Info/FAQ block
- Current page contains FAQ entries:
  - "What is a credential?"
  - "What is a reputation score?"

#### Step-by-step
1. Open `/earn`.
2. Read source cards and choose one action CTA.
3. Click through to source route.

#### Common errors
- If wallet data fails to load, score panel can remain generic.

#### Tips
- Start with `Complete Tasks` or `Community` for quickest early score.

---

### 4.3 Create Task Page (`/create-job`)

#### What this page is for
- Post a regular escrowed task.

#### Who should use it
- Approved operators posting tasks.

#### Requirements
- Connected wallet on configured chain.
- Enough USDC balance.
- Sufficient USDC allowance for job contract.
- If ARC gate enabled in config, must satisfy minimum ARC balance.

#### Fields
- Task Title
- Description
- Deadline (datetime)
- Reward Pool (USDC)
- Max Approvals (1..20)

#### Max Approvals meaning
- Maximum number of contributors that can be approved for one task.
- Used with min stake rule to enforce minimum pool size.

#### Two-step escrow UX (explicit)

Step 1 state (if allowance < reward)
- Shows:
  - `Step 1 of 2: Approve USDC`
  - Approval explanation
  - `Approve X.XX USDC` button
  - grey text: `Step 2: Create Task (unlocks after approval)`
- Post button hidden.

Step 2 state (if allowance >= reward)
- Shows green check: `? USDC Approved`
- Shows active `Post Task` button.
- Clicking Post executes `createJob` only.

Transition behavior
- After approve tx confirms, page rechecks allowance and unlocks Step 2 without refresh.
- If reward input increases above current allowance, UI returns to Step 1.

#### Real-time USDC balance warning
- On reward input changes, page fetches `usdc.balanceOf(wallet)` and allowance.
- If insufficient:
  - red warning below reward input.
  - posting disabled.
- While checking:
  - subtle `Checking balance...` text.
- RPC failure behavior:
  - fails silently (no crash).

#### Step-by-step
1. Fill title/description/deadline/reward/max approvals.
2. Confirm minimum pool message.
3. If Step 1 appears, approve USDC first.
4. When `? USDC Approved` appears, click `Post Task`.
5. Wait for success and task ID message.

#### Common errors
- "Reward pool must be at least ..." -> reward too low for max approvals.
- "Switch wallet network ..." -> wrong chain.
- "Step 1 required: approve USDC..." -> allowance insufficient.

#### Tips
- Set max approvals based on real expected winner count to avoid over-committing pool.
- Write acceptance criteria in description to speed approvals.

---

## SECTION 5: PLATFORM ADMIN GUIDE

> Important repository reality: the following scripts requested in your prompt are **not present** in current code snapshot:
> - `contracts/scripts/admin/approve-operator.ts`
> - `contracts/scripts/admin/revoke-operator.ts`
> - `contracts/scripts/admin/approve-community.ts`
> - `contracts/scripts/admin/list-pending.ts`
> - `contracts/scripts/admin/platform-stats.ts`
>
> Present admin scripts are:
> - `_setup.ts`
> - `add-moderator.ts`
> - `add-arbitrator.ts`
> - `add-governor.ts`

### 5.1 Prerequisites

#### Admin wallet
- Admin authority is whichever wallet is current `owner` on each contract.
- Use the owner key in `contracts/.env` as `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

#### Working directory
1. `cd contracts`
2. Use hardhat scripts with proper network flag.

#### Network flag
- Local: `--network localhost`
- Arc testnet aliases in config: `arcTestnet` and `arc_testnet`

### 5.2 Checking Platform Health

- Script referenced in request (`platform-stats.ts`) is missing.
- Current equivalent checks can be run with:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/e2e-check.ts --network arc_testnet
```

What it checks (10 checks in current file):
- registry deployed and empty expected count condition
- source registry owner exists
- job USDC address and treasury/fee config
- source contract registration in hook
- milestone escrow USDC config
- seeded moderator count

### 5.3 Viewing Pending Applications

- Requested `list-pending.ts` is missing.
- Current alternative from frontend/admin data model:
  - SourceRegistry exposes `getPendingApplicants(sourceType)`.
  - CommunitySource exposes `getPendingApplications()`.
- You can query through hardhat console or write scripts using `_setup.ts` helper.

### 5.4 Approving a Task Creator

- Requested `approve-operator.ts` is missing.
- Equivalent contract call is:

```solidity
SourceRegistry.approveOperator(string sourceType, address operator)
```

Recommended source types:
- `task`
- `agent_task`
- `community`
- `github`

### 5.5 Revoking an Operator

- Requested `revoke-operator.ts` is missing.
- Equivalent contract call:

```solidity
SourceRegistry.revokeOperator(string sourceType, address operator)
```

Effect on existing data:
- Existing tasks/credentials remain on-chain.
- Revoked operator loses permission for future gated actions.

### 5.6 Adding a Community Moderator

Use provided script:

```bash
# set env vars first
$env:MODERATOR_ADDRESS="0x..."
$env:DISPLAY_NAME="Platform Admin"
$env:ROLE="Archon Founder"
$env:PROFILE_URI="https://..."
npx hardhat run scripts/admin/add-moderator.ts --network arc_testnet
```

What script does:
1. Ensures address approved in SourceRegistry for `community`.
2. Calls `CommunitySource.registerModerator(...)`.
3. Prints resulting moderator profile.

### 5.7 Approving a Community Application

- Requested `approve-community.ts` is missing.
- Equivalent contract call:

```solidity
CommunitySource.approveApplication(uint256 applicationId, CommunityActivityType activityType, string reviewNote)
```

Activity type values from contract enum:
- `0 = DiscordHelp`
- `1 = Moderation`
- `2 = ContentCreation`
- `3 = EventOrganization`
- `4 = BugReport`

### 5.8 Adding a Dispute Arbitrator

Use script:

```bash
# either explicit address:
$env:ARBITRATOR_ADDRESS="0x..."
# or signer index:
$env:ARBITRATOR_INDEX="1"
npx hardhat run scripts/admin/add-arbitrator.ts --network arc_testnet
```

Guidance:
- Choose trusted, independent wallets.
- At least 3 arbitrators required before disputes can be raised.

### 5.9 Adding a DAO Governor

Use script:

```bash
$env:GOVERNOR_ADDRESS="0x..."
$env:DAO_NAME="My DAO"
npx hardhat run scripts/admin/add-governor.ts --network arc_testnet
```

Effect:
- Enables users to claim governance credentials against that governor contract.

### 5.10 Platform Fee Management

Current fee values in deployed config:
- job/agent-task fee target: 1000 bps (10%)

Hard limits:
- `ERC8183Job`: fee must be <= 2000 bps
- `AgentTaskSource`: fee must be <= 2000 bps
- `MilestoneEscrow`: fee must be <= 3000 bps

Where fees go:
- Job/AgentTask: `platformTreasury`
- MilestoneEscrow: `owner` of milestone escrow contract (current implementation)

### 5.11 Security Checklist for Admin
- Keep `contracts/.env` out of git (verify `.gitignore` contains `.env`).
- Rotate deployer key periodically.
- Revoke compromised operators immediately in SourceRegistry.
- Investigate suspicious credential patterns via:
  - job suspicion scoring
  - moderation notes
  - source-specific event history
- Fraudulent credentials cannot be deleted by current registry API; mitigation is governance/flagging at application layer and tightening source controls.

## CODE SNAPSHOT GAPS / NON-DETERMINABLE ITEMS

These could not be determined exactly because they are absent or not implemented in the current repository:
- Missing admin scripts named in request:
  - `approve-operator.ts`, `revoke-operator.ts`, `approve-community.ts`, `list-pending.ts`, `platform-stats.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/404.tsx` does not exist; project uses `frontend/src/app/not-found.tsx`.
- No per-tier color mapping table exists in code; tier text/progress currently use shared accent style.
- MilestoneEscrow stores `credentialHook` address but does not mint credentials in current implementation.
