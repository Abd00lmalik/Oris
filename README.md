## What Is Archon

Archon is a structured task platform with a sealed submission system, 5-day reveal phase, and on-chain reputation credentials.

Key difference from other platforms: **submissions are hidden until the creator selects finalists.** No copying. Every solution is independent.

---

## How It Works

### 1 — Task Posted
Creator writes problem, locks USDC in escrow, sets submission deadline.

### 2 — Sealed Submissions
Anyone submits a solution as a public link. Other participants cannot see submissions until the reveal phase. Independent solutions only.

### 3 — Creator Selects Finalists
After deadline, creator reviews privately and selects top submissions as finalists (up to maxApprovals + 5).

### 4 — Reveal Phase (5 Days)
Finalist submissions become visible to all.
Participants can interact with two structured response types:

**BUILD ON** — Extend a submission with new work.  
If your build-on is selected as winner: reward splits 70% (parent) / 30% (build-on).

**CRITIQUE** — Identify a specific flaw with evidence.  
If confirmed valid by creator: +reputation. If spam: stake slashed 50%.

Each response requires a 2 USDC stake (returned after 7 days unless slashed).

### 5 — Signal Map
Treemap heatmap showing all participants by interaction weight. Green = builders. Red = critics. Size = activity share.

### 6 — Creator Finalizes Winners
After reveal phase, creator selects final winners from finalists. Signals are guidance only — creator has final authority.

### 7 — Claim USDC + Credential
Winners claim USDC payout and a permanent ERC-8004 on-chain credential.
